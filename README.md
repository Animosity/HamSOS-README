## How to TEST your radio/messages with HamSOS:
Use a radio message service such as WinLink or SOTAMate (or any others!) to transmit an email message to:
* `HamJazzSOS+test@gmail.com`
* OR `HamJazzSOS+testing@gmail.com`
Note: SOTAMates messages are pre-defined/canned messages and for emergencies, you should create an "I'M OK" message and an "I NEED HELP" message, each with instructions on how to relay the status to your desired contacts. See "How to use HamSOS in emergencies" for other information you may wish to include.

## How to use HamSOS in emergencies:
Use a radio message service such as WinLink or SOTAMate (or any others!) to transmit an email message to `HamJazzSOS@gmail.com` with actionable information included:

**WHO** you are 
* Callsign, and/or legal name

**WHERE** you are - examples:
* GPS/position coordinates 
* Maidenhead grid square
* City/County/State/Province

**WHAT** you need:

* Number of persons impacted?
* Injuries sustained? 
* Medications needed?

**HOW** to contact you (if applicable):
* What frequency you are monitoring 
* How often (sked) you are monitoring 

Upon receiving the email message, the HamSOS service will relay the email message to amateur volunteers monitoring the HamSOS Discord channels. Volunteers may attempt to respond to your email message (if possible) in order to acknowledge the status of request/s made in your email message. 

It is unlawful to knowingly use HamSOS to falsely report (or circulate reports of) emergencies that will cause action of any sort by an official or volunteer agency organized to deal with emergencies. Abuses of the HamSOS service will be forwarded to appropriate law enforcement authorities.
